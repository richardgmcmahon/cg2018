The current proposals is using:

CG2019_2022.tex
cg2081.sty
Makefile

Single cases use:

CG2019_2022_master_v3.tex

The file naming convention is not intuitive and CG2019_2022.tex might
be out of synch with the single case master since CG2019_2022.tex is
the live proposal. Backups can be found on github, the periodic
tar archives and also the Netapp .snapshot directories.

make all [does what it says]

make backup [also creates a tar file]

make draft [like make all but adds a draft suffix]

This is useful if you have used cgdraft option in the latex file to
create a pdf without images being rendered. Note the cgdraft option
requires a 'by hand' edit to the master latex file.
